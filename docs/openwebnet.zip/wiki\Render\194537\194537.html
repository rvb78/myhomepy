<div class="wikidoc"><b>Project Description</b><br />.Net libraries for OpenWebNet protocol and some tools<br /><br />OpenWebNet is the protocol used to communicate with MyHome electric network created by Bticino.<br />You can find more info at www.myopen-bticino.it<br /><br />Here you can find the .Net libs, in order to communicate with MyHome devices, and some tools which use them.<br />Libs support USB/Serial RS232 Gateway and Ethernet Gateways (therefore you can&#39;t manage all types of devices from the former)<br /><br />There are still a lot of things to do and we release them as soon as possible.<br /><br />For help or questions send me a message.<br /><br />Thanks to Lorenzo and Mirko for their support.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
